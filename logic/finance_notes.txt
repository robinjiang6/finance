some notes on how to use yfinance:


msft = yfinance.Ticker("MSFT")

# get info as dict
s = msft.info

# get current price of stock
s['currentPrice']

# get history price of stock
https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/wiki/Ticker
hist = msft.history(start = "yyyy-mm-dd", end = 'yyyy-mm-dd')

# get row at index i = 0
hist.iloc[[0]] # for a panda DataFrame row
hist.iloc[0] # for a "dict" of the row
hist.iloc[0]["Open"] # for the open price


# first date a stock is available:
msft.info['firstTradeDateEpochUtc']
# times in epoch, need to convert to human time


a = search year < this year
b = search month < this month

while( a OR (a' AND b)
